<h1>McCulloch-Pitts Neuron vs Perceptron: A Pratchett-Style Comparison</h1>

<h2>The Tale of Two Neurons</h2>

<p>Once upon a time, in a land full of binary logic and squiggly math, two neurons set out to change the world of computing. One was called <strong>McCulloch-Pitts</strong>, and the other, somewhat more adventurous, was named <strong>Perceptron</strong>. Their personalities were very different, and, much like wizards and trolls, they didn’t always get along.</p>

<p>Here’s how they compared:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Feature</th>
            <th>McCulloch-Pitts Neuron</th>
            <th>Perceptron</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Activation Function</td>
            <td>The ol' step function, a no-nonsense approach. "If it's above this line, I’ll say 1. Otherwise, 0. Simple. Done."</td>
            <td>Step function again, but with a twist! Now it's ready to learn. "I'll adjust myself and get better with each mistake!"</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Weights</td>
            <td>Well, let's call them "binary" and rather passive. Fixed at 1 or 0, they just sit there and wait to be summed.</td>
            <td>Ah, <strong>adjustable</strong> weights, like a knight sharpening his sword before the battle. These weights <strong>learn</strong> and change with every misstep.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Training Method</td>
            <td>Ha! Training? No time for that. It's <strong>static</strong>, like a book that can’t be edited. You get what you get, and you don’t ask for more.</td>
            <td>Training! Yes, this is where things get interesting. <strong>Perceptron</strong> learns from its mistakes, using the <strong>Perceptron learning rule</strong>. It’s like learning to cook: the first few tries might burn the soup, but eventually, it makes something edible.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Bias/Threshold</td>
            <td>The bias is <strong>fixed</strong>—it's like trying to move an immovable object. It <strong>cannot</strong> be changed.</td>
            <td>The bias, on the other hand, is <strong>trainable</strong>, constantly shifting like a wizard trying to find the right amount of magic for a spell.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Application</td>
            <td>Small tasks. Logical gates like AND and OR, but ask it to do XOR, and it might just give you a blank stare.</td>
            <td>Can tackle <strong>binary classification</strong> with grace. With a little training, it learns to do more, like solving the XOR problem and maybe even cooking dinner. Who knows?</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Learning Rule</td>
            <td>No learning rule. The McCulloch-Pitts neuron does its job once and never changes. <strong>Static. Unchanging. Eternal.**</td>
            <td>Learning rule? Ah yes, the <strong>Perceptron learning rule</strong>. It's like a book that gets better with each chapter—adjusting the weights based on errors. It learns and grows with experience.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Model Complexity</td>
            <td>Very simple. Think of a <strong>one-trick pony</strong> who does just one thing and does it well.</td>
            <td>More flexible, but requires <strong>training</strong>. Like an apprentice learning a new craft, the <strong>Perceptron</strong> grows more powerful with each mistake.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p class="fun-text">In the end, the McCulloch-Pitts neuron is a bit of a <strong>static old sage</strong>, while the Perceptron is the <strong>young, ambitious learner</strong> willing to improve and adapt over time. One’s all about simplicity, the other is about growth, training, and <strong>getting better with every mistake</strong>. Who would have guessed?</p>
